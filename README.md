## Design System

| Font | Use |
|------|-----|
| `Playfair Display` | Headings, titles |
| `Caveat` | Handwritten accents, taglines |
| `Lora` | Body copy, navigation |

| Variable | Hex | Use |
|----------|-----|-----|
| `--green-deep` | `#1a3a2a` | Nav, primary dark |
| `--green-mid` | `#2d5c40` | Hover states |
| `--green-water` | `#2d6b5e` | Available dates, success |
| `--amber` | `#c8793a` | Primary CTA |
| `--gold` | `#d4a855` | Logo accents, impact numbers |
| `--cream` | `#f7edd8` | Section backgrounds |
| `--cream-dark` | `#ede0c8` | Borders, card backgrounds |
| `--white` | `#fdf8f0` | Page background |
| `--text-dark` | `#1e2a1e` | Primary body text |
| `--text-mid` | `#3d4f3a` | Secondary body text |

Dark mode swaps these variables via `[data-theme="dark"]` — toggle persists in `localStorage`.
